# Phillips Hue 

## Setup

In order to use the `basestation` to control a Phillips Hue basestation you first must obtain the base station's 
username, a process as described in Phillip's [Developer Guide](http://www.developers.meethue.com/documentation/getting-started),
and required physical access to the device.  Once a username is obtained it will continue to remain valid, so this process
only needs to be perfomed once.  The username should be set on the `basestation` as follows e.g.

    basestation({username:"6ba5c7d32222e31f779722a818296a09"})

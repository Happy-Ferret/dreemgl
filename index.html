<p>More and more product opportunities and design problems involve prototyping applications that connect large screens in the environment to handheld devices or tablets.  At the same time, UI on these screens is evolving to take advantage of faster GPU capabilities.  Dreem is built to enable teams of designers and developers to collaborate on real, functional prototypes that explore both the power of accelerated graphical UIs and multiscreen user experiences.</p>

<p>DREEM allows developers and designers to create ‘compositions’, applications running across many screens and devices in the environment.  Compositions can include networks of users’ personal devices, handheld devices connected to the room, like remotes, and environmental sensors and actuators, like lighting systems.  Input can come from a range of services in the connected space, like depth cameras and physical controllers.</p>

<p>For designers, the development environment includes tools to layout screens visually and preview them in live GL contexts.  Prototype developers and users can connect data services to experiences running on big screens, extend controls to multiple handhelds, and utilize IoT devices all from a visual composition editor.</p>

<p>Prototypes built in DREEM are meant to allow designers to easily test compositions that connect multiple users in shared experiences on big screens or projections, while allowing each person to use the control tools and preferences they have configured.  Compositions can include many roles that user dynamically choose as they join the shared experience</p>
